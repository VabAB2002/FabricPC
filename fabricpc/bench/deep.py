"""The deep FC-ResNet rows: mnist-fcresnet{depth}-{spc,epc,backprop}.

Sponsor issue #59 asks us to test muPC past the depths pcx tried, to 100
layers and more. These rows are the network from ``examples/mupc_demo.py``
at depths 8, 16, 32, 64 and 128, so one command per depth gives accuracy
against depth for all three methods on the same graph:

    input(784) -> stem(64) -> depth x LinearResidual(64, tanh) -> output(10)

Each block is a single PC node, ``z = tanh(W x + b) + x``: the weight path
goes into the node's "in" slot and the identity skip into its "skip" slot.
muPC scales the weight path by gain / sqrt(64 * depth) and leaves the skip
alone. That skip is the whole point: muPC only keeps deep nets trainable
because the identity path carries the signal, so a plain deep chain would
not do. The stem gets 1 / sqrt(784) and the softmax readout (Xavier, cross
entropy) is left out of muPC, all as in the demo.

Everything else is the demo's defaults too, so the sponsor's own table can
be checked against ours: width 64, batch 256, 3 epochs, AdamW at 0.002 with
weight decay 0.01, and sPC settles with rate 0.1 for max(20, 3 * (depth +
2)) steps. The demo's table (sPC, one run each) reads 92.0, 89.7, 85.6,
84.1 and 82.2% at depths 8, 16, 32, 64 and 128. We do not use those as
expected scores, because they are single runs with the demo's seed.

Two things differ from the demo, both for all three methods alike: Adam's
epsilon is 1e-12 like our other deep rows, and the PC rows get the usual
rate safety net. ePC uses its defaults, like the MLP rows.

This is the demo's recipe, not the muPC paper's (Innocenti et al., NeurIPS
2025, arXiv 2505.13124). The paper applies the activation before the matmul
(W tanh(z) + z), has no biases and no Kaiming gain, puts muPC on the readout
with a squared-error loss, and trains with Adam at 0.1, batch 64, one epoch,
and as many settling steps as there are hidden layers. The paper's accuracy
stays flat with depth; the demo's falls. A paper-faithful variant needs a
pre-activation option on LinearResidual first, so it is left for later.

Depths 32 and up are tier 2: on a laptop CPU they are slow (see the probe).
