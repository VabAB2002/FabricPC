"""Pass or fail: does a row's result land near the score it should?

Issue #59 asks for a task-metric band on every row, so a configuration that
runs fast but trains badly fails instead of looking good in a table. A row
passes when

    |mean - expected| <= max(floor, 2 * SE)

where the mean and standard error (SE) come from the row's trials and the
floor is the smallest miss we allow (half a percentage point of accuracy by
default). Two standard errors lets a noisy row wobble as much as its own
seeds do. This rule and the 5-seed count are our proposal; the sponsor has
not signed off yet, so every verdict says so.

A verdict is only given for a full run: the row's own epoch count and at
least its stated number of seeds. Anything shorter, like the CI smoke run,
is marked not comparable instead of passing or failing by accident.
