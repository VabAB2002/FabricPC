"""Comparisons between rows, computed by fabricpc.experiments.

Issue #59 asks that every benchmark go through
``PlannedMultiContrastExperiment``. That runner trains every arm inside one
process and records only the task metric and wall time, while the suite runs
each trial in its own process and records timing, memory, and compute too.
So the suite does the training, and this module hands the finished trials to
the framework's own results class, whose ``contrast_results()`` does the
paired t-tests and effect sizes. The statistics are the framework's, not a
copy of them.

That is only honest if a trial here trains the same model the framework
would. ``arm_for_row`` builds the framework's view of a row, and the tests
check that both give the same accuracy for the same seed.
