"""The BPE Tiny Shakespeare transformer rows:
tinyshakespeare-bpe-transformer-{spc,epc,backprop}.

The same recipe as the char transformer rows in ``registry`` (the v2
builder, normal weight init, norm-clipped settling, cosine decay to a tenth
of the rate, Adam epsilon 1e-12, the safety net on the PC rows, scored on
perplexity), but on BPE tokens with the settings the sponsor's demo ships
for them: ``BPE_DEFAULTS`` in ``examples/transformer_v2_demo.py``.

    embed 128, 4 heads, MLP 512, 4 blocks, 64 tokens per sequence
    batch 32, 5 epochs, 23 settling steps, eta_infer 0.0656,
    lr 1.68e-5, weight init std 0.0399, norm clip 5.0

The one change from the demo is Adam's epsilon (1e-12 instead of 1e-8), for
the reason given at ``_DEEP_ADAM_EPS`` in the registry. The demo has no
dropout or weight decay and neither do these rows.

How to read the score: the demo's comment gives val perplexity about 1133
and test about 721, but those came from tuning on a 50k-sequence subset of
the training text, and it calls the setting a placeholder. These rows train
on all of it (about 240,900 sequences, roughly 4.8 times as much), so the
demo's numbers are a rough guide, not this row's setting. The yardstick is
guessing each token by how common it is in the training text (a unigram
model with add-one smoothing): about 790 on test and about 674 on val. The
rows are scored on test, so compare them with the test pair only: unigram
790 and the demo's 721. (The demo's val 1133 is about 1.7 times worse than
the val unigram, so it is not a fair number to hold a row to.) Per-token
perplexity also cannot be compared with the char rows, since a BPE token
here is about 4 characters.

The tokenizer is ``BpeDataLoader``'s own (HuggingFace ``tokenizers``, 11711
ids, trained on all three splits). It is trained once, in a few seconds, and
cached with the encoded splits in ``bpe_cache_dir()``, which is outside the
repo so the files never end up in git.

This lives in its own module so the registry only needs one line for it.
Its imports from the registry happen inside the functions, because the
registry imports this module while it is still being built.
