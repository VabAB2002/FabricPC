"""Guess how long (and how much) a benchmark run will take, without running it.

    python -m fabricpc.bench probe <row|family> [--trials N] [--epochs E]
                                                [--price-per-hour P]

For each row we build the model and the loaders, compile the training step
and time a handful of steps with ``measure.time_steps`` (the same code a real
trial uses), then multiply out:

    one seed = compile + steps per epoch * epochs * median step + evaluation
    the row  = trials * one seed
    cost     = hours * price per hour

Evaluation is timed too, on a few test batches. ``evaluate`` builds a fresh
jitted function every time it is called, so each call pays a compile. We
time it twice, once on 1 batch and once on 1 + k batches, and the difference
gives the per-batch time; what is left over is the compile. Each is the
best of two tries, since compile times wobble.

What is not counted: the inference-rate safety net's probes (the registry
says about a tenth extra on PC rows), the diagnostics, and starting one
Python process per trial. So read the estimate as a floor, not a promise.
The numbers only hold for the hardware they were measured on, so the report
says which device that was.
