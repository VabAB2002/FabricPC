"""Hopfield rows: get a stored pattern back from a noisy copy.

With today's settings these are trained one-layer denoisers, not yet a test
of attractor recall; see the notes below.

The scope asks for associative-memory retrieval: recall a whole pattern from
a corrupted cue, with Hopfield nodes. This follows the binary experiment in
``examples/storkey_hopfield_recall.py``: seven random +1/-1 patterns of 64
bits, a three-node graph probe -> StorkeyHopfield -> output, trained on
(noisy copy, clean pattern) pairs with 15% of the bits flipped.

A few things are worth saying plainly, because the node's name suggests more
than it does:

- ``StorkeyHopfield`` does not use the Storkey learning rule. Its W starts
  small and is learned by gradient descent, so what we train here is a
  denoiser that has seen 100 noisy copies of each pattern for 30 epochs, not
  a memory written once from clean patterns.
- So every row also reports the real Storkey rule (Storkey 1997) on the same
  patterns and the same noisy probes, as ``storkey_rule_*``. It does not
  depend on training, so it is the same number in all three rows; it is a
  fixed ruler, not a fourth method.
- Backprop does have a recall mode on this graph: one forward pass through
  the node, probe -> tanh(blend of probe and probe @ W). sPC and ePC read the
  recalled pattern after inference settles, but with these settings settling
  changes the one-pass readout by 0.002 or less (the ``forward_*`` scores
  show it). So all three rows are one-layer denoisers that differ only in
  how W was trained. They do not test attractor recall yet.
- Every row also scores the do-nothing baseline, the noisy probe handed
  back unchanged, as ``probe_*``, and the lift over it as
  ``bit_accuracy_lift_*``. A row that learned nothing has a lift of 0.

Recall is read from the Hopfield node's latent after settling (as in the
example) and turned into bits with sign(), where 0 counts as +1. The example
recalls with 100 inference steps; the rows use the training graph's 20,
because on our check 100 steps moved bit accuracy by 0.002 at most.

Scores, at each flip rate p in NOISE_LEVELS (named ``_p20`` for 20%):

- ``bit_accuracy``: fraction of bits that match the stored pattern. The
  overlap m used in the physics papers is just 2 * bit_accuracy - 1.
- ``exact_recall``: fraction of probes brought back with every bit right.
- ``nearest_correct``: fraction whose output is closer to the right pattern
  than to any other stored one. The example calls this "exact"; there a
  tie goes to whichever pattern comes first, here a tie does not count.

At p = 0 any network that keeps the probe's signs is perfect, so it only
checks that nothing is destroyed, not that the patterns are stored. p = 0.5
is chance (bit accuracy near 0.5): any recall there is luck.
