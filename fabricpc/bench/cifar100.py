"""The CIFAR-100 VGG-5 rows: cifar100-vgg5-{spc,epc,backprop}.

The same recipe as the CIFAR-10 VGG-5 rows in ``registry`` (fused conv and
pool nodes, flips and 4-pixel crops, warmup then cosine decay, Adam epsilon
1e-12, the safety net on the PC rows), with 100 classes and the settings
pcx shipped for CIFAR-100.

Where the numbers come from: pcx's VGG-5 CIFAR-100 configs, on the
``build-docs`` branch of github.com/liukidar/pcx under
``examples/s4_1_discriminative_mode/VGG5/cifar100/``. Our rows clamp the
output to the label and use cross-entropy, which is pcx's PC-CE method, so
we take ``VGG5_PCN_CE_cifar100.yaml``:

    T = 12, act_fn = hard_tanh, batch 128, 50 epochs
    weights: AdamW, lr 0.00021550147504766553, wd 0.007599378216624812
    states:  SGD, lr 0.011510981082033004, momentum 0.25

What pcx reports (arXiv 2407.01163v2, Table 1, VGG-5, CIFAR-100 top-1):
67.19 +- 0.24 for PC with centered nudging, the best PC number, but that
method is not one of ours and pcx ships no config for it. The methods closest
to our rows score 60.00 +- 0.19 (PC-CE) and 60.82 +- 0.10 (backprop with
cross-entropy). None of these is used as an expected score: like the
CIFAR-10 rows, these rows get one from their own first full GPU run.

This lives in its own module so the registry only needs one line for it.
Its imports from the registry happen inside the functions, because the
registry imports this module while it is still being built.
