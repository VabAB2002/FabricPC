"""Run each trial in its own Python process.

A fresh process gets a fresh JAX memory pool, so a trial's peak memory is
its own and not left over from the trial before it. It also means a trial
that crashes hard (out of memory, a segfault in a device driver) cannot
take the other trials down with it.

The child is just the normal command line with ``--trial i --in-process``:
it trains one trial and writes ``trial<i>.json`` like any other run. The
parent only has to start it and read that file back. If the child dies
before writing it, the parent writes a failed result with the exit code
and the end of the child's error output, so the run still records what
happened.
