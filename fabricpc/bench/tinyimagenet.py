"""The Tiny-ImageNet VGG-5 rows: tinyimagenet-vgg5-{spc,epc,backprop}.

The same recipe as the CIFAR VGG-5 rows (fused conv and pool nodes, warmup
then cosine decay, Adam epsilon 1e-12, the safety net on the PC rows), with
200 classes, 56x56 crops of the 64x64 images, and the settings pcx shipped
for Tiny-ImageNet.

Where the numbers come from: pcx's VGG-5 Tiny-ImageNet configs, on the
``build-docs`` branch of github.com/liukidar/pcx under
``examples/s4_1_discriminative_mode/VGG5/tinyimagenet/``. Our PC rows clamp
the output to the label and use cross-entropy, which is pcx's PC-CE method,
so they take ``VGG5_PCN_CE_tinyimagenet.yaml``; the backprop row takes
``VGG5_BP_CE_tinyimagenet.yaml``:

    PC-CE: T = 7, act_fn = hard_tanh, batch 128, 50 epochs
           weights: AdamW, lr 4.463151374486534e-05, wd 0.0014288405442168734
           states:  SGD, lr 0.010044339247287183, momentum 0.05
    BP-CE: act_fn = hard_tanh, batch 128, 50 epochs
           weights: AdamW, lr 8.709909364802776e-05, wd 2.0892453778883236e-05

Data, as in pcx's scripts: training images get a random left-right flip and
a random 56x56 window with no padding; the model is scored on the centre
56x56 of the 10,000 ``val`` images, because the official test split has no
labels (pcx's "test" numbers are val numbers too). Both use ImageNet's
channel mean and std. So VGG-5 sees 56 -> 28 -> 14 -> 7 -> 3, and the last
layer reads 3x3x512 features, the same shapes as pcx.

What pcx reports (arXiv 2407.01163v2, Table 1, VGG-5, Tiny-ImageNet, top-1
and top-5): the best number, 46.40 +- 0.1 top-1, is negative nudging (NN),
which is not one of our methods. The fair numbers for our rows are PC-CE,
41.29 +- 0.2 top-1 (66.68 top-5), and backprop with cross-entropy, 43.72 +-
0.1 top-1 (69.23 top-5). pcx keeps the best epoch of each run and averages
5 of 7 seeds; we score the last epoch. None of these is used as an expected
score: the rows get one from their own first full GPU run.

This lives in its own module so the registry only needs one line for it.
Its imports from the registry happen inside the functions, because the
registry imports this module while it is still being built.
