"""Fix results that older code wrote, without training anything again.

Some numbers in a trial file are worked out from the run, not measured,
so when the code that works them out gets a bug fix the old files can be
corrected on a laptop in a few seconds:

* ``compute`` and ``achieved_tflops``. The FLOP count is rebuilt from the
  row's graph with today's ``fabricpc.bench.compute`` (the graph is code,
  so building it again costs nothing), and the TFLOP/s is that count over
  the step time the run measured. The settling steps and batch size the
  run used are kept, so the count describes the run that happened.
* ``checkpoint``. Older runs saved the absolute path on the cloud machine.
  When the zoo is on disk, the path is rewritten relative to the new
  results folder, the way a fresh run writes it.
* ``peak_memory_bytes``. Older runs only had the process-wide peak, which
  on GPU is mostly compile scratch space and comes out the same for every
  algorithm. The value is kept but marked as not comparable. We do not
  make up a ``step_memory``; that needs the run itself.

Everything the run measured (metrics, times, seeds) is copied unchanged.
The input folder is only read. Every trial and manifest gets a ``refresh``
list saying what changed, from what, to what, and with which commit, and
the manifest keeps the commit that did the training. ``summary.json``,
``trials.csv`` and every comparison the old folder had are rebuilt with the
normal code. A compare file that cannot be rebuilt is copied as it was and
listed in the new ``NOTES.md``, and the old ``NOTES.md`` is kept under a
line saying what was corrected. Every row is checked (known to the
registry, same weighted edges and parameter count, nothing already in the
output folder) before any file is written.
