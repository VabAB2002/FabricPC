"""Quick numeric regression checks for CI.

    python -m fabricpc.bench regress [--out DIR] [row-id ...]

The unit tests prove the code runs. ``smoke`` proves one MNIST model still
learns. This goes one step further: it trains a few tiny models, each with
sPC, ePC and backprop, and checks that every score is still on the right
side of a fixed line. A change that quietly makes the library worse (a
wrong sign in a gradient, an inference step that stopped doing anything)
shows up here as a FAIL, even when every unit test still passes.

The checks:

- ``mnist-mlp-*``: half an epoch of MNIST, test accuracy at least 0.85
  (the same floor the smoke run has always used).
- ``mnist-autoencoder-*``: half an epoch, test reconstruction MSE at most
  0.055. Handing back the average training image scores 0.0675, so a model
  that learned nothing useful cannot pass.
- ``patterns64-hopfield-*``: the row's full 30 epochs (it is tiny), bit
  accuracy lift over the noisy probe at 20% flips of at least 0.10. A model
  that learned nothing has a lift of 0.

Each check runs two seeds (trial 0 and 1, the same seeds as every other
run) and compares the mean of the two to its line. The lines were set from
real runs on a Mac with a wide margin, so a slightly different CPU or jax
version does not make CI flaky; see ``MEASURED`` below for what the runs
gave. After the checks, the folder is validated like any other results
folder, and a report page (``report.md``) and ``regress.json`` (every
verdict) are written next to the results.

Every run is short on purpose, so a PASS says "nothing is badly broken",
not "the scores match the paper". The full rows and their bands do that.
